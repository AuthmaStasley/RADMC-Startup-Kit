Quick explanatory directory:

The "density" notebook is where I'd start, contains basically how I write dust_density.inp.

"SED Creation" is where I'd go next, shows how I create SEDs. But this should be familiar to you.

"INP Generation" is just there to show how I make some of the other inp files, but this should also probably be familiar. 

And the rest are various inp files used by RADMC. Some I like to create via notebook, others I tweak manually, but the process is largely the same in all cases.

I made this over the course of a few hours, and there is almost certainly parts of the code that are completely self-explanatory to me, but not to you, so feel free to ask any question needed.
